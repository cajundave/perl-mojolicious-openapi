# Mojolicious API with OpenAPI 2.0/Swagger

This repo contains source code for a [presentation on OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger)](https://scottw.github.io/presentations/perl-mojolicious-openapi/) and how to write an API for it using Mojolicious. This code is for demo purposes only. If you use this for any other reason, you should at least change the secret in the configuration file.

The "time tracker" model code in this repository comes from [another repo](https://github.com/scottw/perl-oo-time-tracker) which is used in [another presentation](https://scottw.github.io/presentations/perl-object-orientation/).

## Presentation

The `SCRIPT.md` file in this repository contains the script I follow when presenting.
